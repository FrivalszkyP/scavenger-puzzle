# Scavenger Escape Room Puzzle

## Used technology

- VueJS is the JS framework.
- Bootstrap CSS grid and utility classes are used for the layout.
- All of these are already used on scavengerescape.com. No additional dependencies are loaded.
- Fonts: Poppins (webfont) and system default Monospace font (Windows: Courier New).
- The puzzle pieces are controlled by checkbox inputs + labels. No JS is involved in displaying the on/off state of the buttons.
- A small VueJS logic handles the logic for the correct solution and counting the clicked puzzle pieces.
- There's a small fade-in effect when the solution appears. This is also controlled by VueJS + some CSS.
